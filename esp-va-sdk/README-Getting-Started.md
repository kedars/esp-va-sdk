# Prerequisites
Please prepare your host system with the toolchain. Please see http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/index.html for the host setup.


# Prepare Images

## Clone all the repositories
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git

$ cd esp-idf; git checkout release/v3.2; cd ..

$ git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-va-sdk.git
```

## Build and flash the project
```
$ cd esp-va-sdk/examples/<example_voice_assistant_directory>

$ export ESPPORT=/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART (or /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1 on Linux or COMxx on MinGW)

$ export IDF_PATH=/path/to/esp-idf

# Set audio_board path. e.g. For LyraT board:
$ export AUDIO_BOARD_PATH=/path/to/esp-va-sdk/board_support_pkgs/lyrat/audio_board/audio_board_lyrat/

$ make -j 8 flash monitor
```
NOTE:
> The google_voice_assistant and google_dialogflow applications only support Tap-to-talk whereas the amazon_alexa application supports both, "Alexa" wakeword and tap-to-talk.

# Upgrading from Previous Release
Please skip this section if you are using the SDK for the first time.

## Upgrading to 1.0-RC1

* The example applications have changed from hardware specific to voice assistant specific.
  * Hardware/Board specific configuration (specifically, LEDs, Hardware Codecs, DSP and the board) is moved into a separate board support package. Please pass the path of this package to the build command line as indicated above.
* The esp-idf branch needs to be changed to release/v3.2 from release/v3.1 and the relevant new patches need to be applied.
* The nvs version is changed with IDF release/v3.2. Please do `make erase-flash` before flashing the new app. Now re-provision the device.
* Provisioning and authentication of Alexa app is now carried out over BLE instead of SoftAP. Use the new Android app for the same. (iOS app support is comming soon). GVA and Dialogflow would continue to use their respective older provisioning methods for now.


## Upgrading to v1.0b1r7 (Beta)

* Most API names have changed from alexa\_ to va\_. Please follow these steps to upgrade.
* Download script v1_0r6Tov1_0r7_update_script.sh available under "releases" tab, and copy it in SDK's root directory (esp-voice-assistants).
* Copy your example in examples directory.
* Run the script using below commands:
    * cd /path/to/esp-voice-assistants
    * ./v1_0r6Tov1_0r7_update_script.sh

## Upgrading to v1.0b1r6 (Beta)

* Release v1.0b1r6 changes the way WiFi credentials are stored in NVS. Hence when you upgrade your device to latest SDK, your device would go into provisioning mode again, and needs to be re-provisioned via provisioning app.
